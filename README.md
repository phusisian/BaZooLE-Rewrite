# BaZooLE-Rewrite

This is a rewrite of my game, BaZooLE (demo of previous version here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rohIt2EJuWY). Having created the engine for the game myself, it was ripe for error given that it was my first attempt at creating a game engine myself. As a result, the majority of flaws present in the game are a result of my homemade engine. I found that the more I added, the more confusing my code became, and the more limiting the engine's structure. With the experience I had garnered from working on the project for so long, I had many ideas in mind that would simplify the way in which the code functions while also offering more freedom than was previously available. The rewrite has yet to exceed the progress of the original game, but it is far easier to work with, and allows for simpler implementation of new ideas while offering entire capabilities previously not available to the engine around which the game is built.
